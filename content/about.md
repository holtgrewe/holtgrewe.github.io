This is the web site of Manuel Holtgrewe, computer scientist, bioinformatician (focus on medical genetics), scientist, engineer, technologist, nerd -- not necessarily in this order.

All thoughts and opinions expressed on this website are my own and are not necessarily shared by my employer.

"What exactly are you doing" you ask?

![DNA + CPU + Hospital + Collaboration](/images/plusplusplus.png)

I'm working with DNA in computers in a clinical setting with wonderful collaborators!

**Bioinformatics Staff Scientist, Beule Lab, BIH**

Since 2022, I am migrating to my role as a **staff scientist** at [Dieter Beule's lab at Berlin Institute of Health](https://www.bihealth.org/de/aktuell/dieter-beule-erhaelt-professur-fuer-translationale-bioinformatik).
Here, I'm continuing my research 

**Core Unit Bioinformatics (CUBI), BIH**

In my third life, I joined the then newly founded Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) in Core **Unit Bioinformatics (CUBI)**.
Together with group leader Dieter Beule and my colleagues, I was fortunate enough being able to shape this world-class group that provides service-oriented scientific collaborations to groups at Berlin Institute of Health, Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and Max Delbrück Center Berlin.
Thanks to the excellent project from our wonderful collaborators my publications are too numerous to list here.
Some highlights:

- **Holtgrewe M**, Stolpe O, Nieminen M, ..., Beule D. "VarFish: comprehensive DNA variant analysis for diagnostics and research". NAR, 2020. [[paper]](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/W1/W162/5825625)

You can find the **full list** of my publications on [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=ej7e0LAAAAAJ&hl=en) and more information on the [**CUBI Website**](https://www.cubi.bihealth.org).

**BIH HPC Team Lead**

Further, I have been the technical lead of the **BIH HPC team** since 2017.
Me and a team of 2-3 others have been planning and operating a cluster of 200-300 nodes, 10k+ cores, 40/100GbE interconnect and 2PB+ of high-performance storage.
You can find more information on the [**BIH HPC Website**](https://www.hpc.bihealth.org) and the documentation that I primarly created at [docs.hpc.bihealth.org](https://docs.hpc.bihealth.org).

**PhD Studies**

I then became an **algorithmic bioinformatician** for my second life in 2009 and worked with [Knut Reinert](http://www.reinert-lab.de/) at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/) for my doctoral studies.
I completed my PhD in bioinformatics working on efficient algorithms for next-generation data processing, read mapping, and structural variant analysis.
During this time, I was one of the main contributors to the [SeqAn library](https://www.seqan.de/).
Some publications from this time.

**Undergraduate and Graduate Studies**

In my first life, I was a **computer scientist** trained at [KIT-Fakultät für Informatik, Karlsruhe](https://www.informatik.kit.edu/).
During my studies, I specialized in algorithmics and parallel processing, you can find my diploma thesis (German Dipl.-Inform.) ["A Scalable Coarsening Phase for a Multi-Level Graph Partitioning Algorithm" on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3294015).
Here are some publications from this time:
